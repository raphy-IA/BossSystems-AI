For SMEs, it represents an unprecedented lever for competitiveness. But where to start?\n\n### 1. Automation of Administrative Tasks\nAI can now handle invoice entry, document filing, and even responding to redundant emails. Estimated time saved: **up to 15 hours per week** for your administrative teams.\n\n### 2. Customer Relationship Personalization\nThanks to LLMs (Large Language Models), you can offer 24/7 customer support that truly understands your interlocutors' needs, with the same finesse as a human agent.\n\n### 3. Simple Predictive Analytics\nPredicting your stock needs or activity peaks has never been so accessible. Modern AI tools analyze your historical data to prevent stockouts or overstocking.\n\n**Conclusion:** The challenge of 2025 is not knowing if you will use AI, but to what extent it will be integrated into the heart of your business processes."

Here are the 5 critical threats to watch.\n\n### 1. Phishing by Deepfake\nAttackers now use AI to clone the voice or image of your executives. Be vigilant about urgent transfer requests, even if they seem to come from the CEO.\n\n### 2. Supply Chain Attacks\nYour SME may be a gateway to a larger client. Hackers target weak links. Secure your supplier access.\n\n**Advice:** Adopt the \"Zero Trust\" principle. Trust no entity by default, even inside your network."

Reduction of Operational Costs\nAutomation reduces human errors and time spent on low-value tasks. Calculate the hourly rate saved x number of hours.\n\n### 2. Revenue Increase\nNew digital sales channels or better conversion thanks to UX can directly boost your revenue.\n\n**The trap to avoid:** Don't just look at immediate financial ROI. Take into account employee satisfaction and customer retention."
